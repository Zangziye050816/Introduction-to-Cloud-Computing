Lab 1:
1.	Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.
Open Task Manager → Performance → CPU → check "Virtualization" status
2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
Three Pros of Cloud:
1.	Scalability - Easy resource scaling up/down based on demand
2.	Cost Efficiency - Pay-as-you-go model reduces capital expenditure
3.	Accessibility - Global access to resources and services from anywhere
Three Cons of Cloud:
1.	Security Concerns - Data stored on third-party servers
2.	Vendor Lock-in - Difficulty migrating between cloud providers
3.	Downtime Risks - Dependency on provider's infrastructure reliability
3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
The primary function of a hypervisor is to create and manage virtual machines by abstracting and partitioning hardware resources, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine.
4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications, sharing resources from the host machine through virtualization.
5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
1.	Hardware consolidation and cost savings
2.	Isolation and security between environments
3.	Easy backup, recovery, and migration
4.	Testing and development flexibility
5.	Legacy application support
6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
1.	Server consolidation in data centers
2.	Software development and testing environments
3.	Running legacy applications on modern hardware
4.	Sandboxing for security testing
5.	Desktop virtualization for remote work
7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system? （B）
a) The main operating system running on the physical machine
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine
c) The operating system running on a remote server
d) The operating system running on a mobile device
8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?（C）
a) Virtual machines can communicate directly with the physical hardware.
b) Virtual machines share the same resources and cannot be isolated.
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.
d) Virtual machines can only be accessed locally.
9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?（C）
a) It allows virtual machines to communicate with each other easily.
b) It ensures faster boot times for virtual machines.
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.
d) It reduces the need for hardware virtualization.
10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
Cloning creates an exact copy of a VM, useful for:
1.	Rapid deployment of identical environments
2.	Backup and disaster recovery
3.	Testing configurations without affecting production
4.	Scaling applications horizontally
